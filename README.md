A place to put some of the tutorials we'll be using for basic python and webscraping in class. 

## Getting started 

First, let's talk about text editors. For the purposes of this class, we're going to be using the MacLab computers and the Sublime text editor installed on them. But if you're working on your own computer, here are some suggestions:

#### For Mac

I suggest installing [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) lately because its free and easy to use. It has everything we need for this tutorial and more.

I also recommend [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). You an use it for free for as long as you want, but it's encouraged to purchase a license to support the software's development. Licenses are $80 and entitle you to use it on as many devices as you like. 

#### For Windows 

Jack and I are both fans of [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). It has a bunch of plugins and a lot of functionality across multiple languages. It's also free.

#### Installation 

First things first, we'll going to have to do some setup on our computers before we can start programming in Python. Each of the MacLab machines has Python 2.7 installed on them, so we'll be using that. Much of what we're going over will translate to Python 3.5 or higher, except for the print statement, which we'll talk about.
